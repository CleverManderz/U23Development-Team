This project was for U23 Development Team. It is an amateur bicycle race team with a focus on teamwork. U23 is a fledgling class of passionate young cyclists that have dreams and aspirations to become the best in their sport. After hearing the reason why they started U23 development team, I definitely wanted to be a huge part of the website and logo design. As the contract Creative Director at Audience Generation I took full lead over the project. They didn’t have much of a budget to go by, but that didn’t stop me from designing and developing them a website and creating a logo that represented them in the best way possible. The monochromatic theme was the best way to go and I knew orange would definitely be a color to pop and accent the site very well. All the young racers were thrilled with the result of the site and were even more thrilled at the fact that I went the extra mile and made it responsive, even though they thought there wasn’t enough time to do it in.
